#Basic EMED Makefile
##A place for the stuff all our installations share

The idea here is to have a shared location of a working makefile that contains all of the common modules to our initial site setups.
In this file is a _partial_ list. If you feel that some should be included that are not, simply commit your changes to the makefile.

If you don't have commit privileges ask.
